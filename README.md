(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
(Mum mum mum mah)
I wanna hold em'
Like they do in Texas please
Fold em' let em' hit me
Raise it baby, stay with me
Love game intuition
Play the cards
With spades to start
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one
That's on his heart
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot
Show 'em what I got
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot
Show 'em what I got
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face
p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face
p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun
When you're with me
Russian Roulette
Is not the
Same without a gun
And baby when it's love
If it's not rough
It isn't fun
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot
Show him what I got
Oh oh oh oh ohhhh
ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot
Show him what I got
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face
p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face
p-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
I won't tell you
That I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin'
With my muffin
I'm not lyin'
I'm just stunnin'
With my love
Glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick
In the casino
Take your bank
Before I pay you out
Promise this
Promise this
Check this hand
'Cause I'm marvelous
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read
My poker face
(She's got me)
(Like nobody)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
P-p-p-poker face
P-p-poker face
(Mum mum mum mah)
